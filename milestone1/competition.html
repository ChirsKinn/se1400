            <h4>Example websites</h4>
            <p>A quick search of colorado lawfirms brought up the following notable websites, gasperlaw.com, hoganlovells.com, and theluxlawfirm.com.
            </p>

            <h4><a href="https://www.gasperlaw.com/">Gasper Law Group</a></h4>
            <p>This website excels in focusing on contacting the firm. Thier landing page has a chat box to the right, and a 'contacct us' button immidiately viewable.
                I dislike however how cluttered the website seems, there are many lines that are unnecessary, and the logo is honestly a bit outdated. 
            </p>

            <h4><a href="https://www.hoganlovells.com/en/locations/colorado-springs">Hogan Lovells</a></h4>
            <p>This site is a good example of what not to do. They ask for cookies out of the gate, which is just an unnecessary step in the process that other sites do not have.
                There is a lot of empty space as well on the website which can be utilized to make it prettier, and the green color scheme is honestly just ugly. 
            </p>

            <h4><a href="https://theluxlawfirm.com/">The Lux Law Firm</a></h4>
            <p>Again, this site askes for cookies and it's just really a bad extra step for a website as simple as a lawfirm website.
                They do have reviews which is a great touch to the landing page, but the link to contacting a lawyer is a little lost in the clutter of the website.  
            </p>

            <h4>What to take from this</h4>
            <p> Things I'd like to avoid are the cookies prompts, cluttering the main page, and a bad logo. I do like the focus on contacting the firm, and a chatbox that potentially could be implimented.
