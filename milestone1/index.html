            <h2>Website Summary</h2>

            <h4>What content will the site contain?</h4>
            <p>The content will contain information related to a lawfirm in Colorado springs, what they specialize in, as well as other awards and certificates to validate the authenticity of the firm. There will 
                also be links and forms to fill out in order for a potential client to get what they are looking for, and for their information to be submitted to the firm.
            </p>

            <h4>Where will you get all of the content for your site (ie. images & text)?</h4>
            <p>Images will come from the firm itself, this includes pictures of the lawers and staff, and also the physical location. The text will be produced by me, and the staff of the business if requested.</p>

            <h4>Why should users care about the focus of the site?</h4>
            <p>In this case, it is a business site. Customers will already be looking for a lawyer that handles their specific need, so this will help them get what they are looking for, and pair them with the service that they need.</p>

            <h4>Why should a site be built for this?</h4>
            <p>It's important for a business like a lawfirm to have a well done website, as much of the business is done online to begin with. If it is well polished, and executed properly, then more customers will be willing to use the firm for their needs.</p>

            <h4>What would you like users to do at your site?</h4>
            <p>Primarily I would want them to submit their info, or call the firm directly, in order to submit a request to meet with a lawyer. The main goal is to get customers on the phone with the firm, or come into the office.</p>

            <h4>What is the goal of the site?</h4>
            <p>The goal is to promote business with the firm, and to make it easy as well as enticing for customers to do business with the firm.</p>
